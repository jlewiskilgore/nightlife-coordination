their area which they are going to that night.

Requirements:

1. Unauthenticated users can view all the bars in their area.

2. Authenticated users can add themselves to a bar to indicate 
they are going there tonight

3. Authenticated users can remove themselves from a bar if they
no longer want to go there.

4. When unauthenticated users login, they do not have to search
again.
